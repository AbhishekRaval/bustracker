The convenience of locating the nearest Bus Stops and tracking your favourite buses
is something that many of us desire. What else could be better if we could have this
convenience at our fingertips. This Next Bus Tracker app allows a user to locate the
nearest bus stops to his location and track his favourite buses for its live information.
It also allows the user to fetch buses to his desired destination from his desired bus
stop. All the information is displayed through an intuitive User Interface that improves
the user experience.

This app is very easy to use. The user registers / signs in depending on whether he
already has a account in the app. The user after signing in is redirected to a home
page from where he can search for a bus or access the buses that he has saved as
favourites. The search bus functionality asks the users for their location and fetches
the nearest bus stops classified by the routes and the directions in which the buses
are travelling. The user can add the bus (trip) as a favourite so that it can be accessed
through the ‘favs’ section. To make the tracking more intuitive a map is also added on
the tracking page that shows the live location of the bus.

The targeted audience for this application is the users who travel by bus regularly. This
app will make it fairly easy for them to track the bus and check the scheduled time of
arrival at their nearest bus stop. 

The Geolocation API does not work and the success callback functions are not
called. So it is better to override the geolocation sensor settings inside Google
Chrome or set the geo.wifi.uri in about:config settings in Mozilla Firefox to:
https://location.services.mozilla.com/v1/geolocate?key=test .
